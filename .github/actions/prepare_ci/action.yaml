    steps:
        # Ideally, we run every CI jobs in some containers as a hermetic to make it easy to reproduce the environment locally.
        # However,
        #   1. Recently, it is delayed to update of Node.js' docker image.
        #      This would not be a high impact problem but this is a remarkable problem for major version.
        #      It sometimes 3~4 weeks delay. We cannot test with a new version immidiately.
        #   2. Old actions/setup-node (v1) cannot install the Node.js that is not listed in the action's database.
        #      It's slower than a docker image. See https://github.com/option-t/option-t/pull/681#issuecomment-658219488
        #      But the recent version of its GH action does not such problem.
        #   3. GH Action job is enough to hermetic to achieve, I think. Any fork can them in their forked repository,
        #      and each of steps of them are almost portable to reproduce them for this project's purpose.
        # So we use `actions/setup-node` simply.
