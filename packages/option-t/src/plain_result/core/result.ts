 *  This is [_result type_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_type).
 *
 *  ## CAUTION:
 *
 *  ### Be careful to use `===` or `Object.is()` to compare the equality of this type
 *
 *  You should use `equal` operator to check the equality for two objects of this type
 *  instead of `===` or `Object.is()`.
 *  Operators for this type sometimes return the inputted object directly
 *  to avoid an unnecessary objecti allocation.
 *
 *  We use this design by the assumption that we would not compare `a` and `b` usually in the following case.
 *  It usually suggest some design problems if you would like to compare these `a` and `b`.
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  const a = createOk(val);
 *  const b = andThen(a, someOperation);
 *  ```
