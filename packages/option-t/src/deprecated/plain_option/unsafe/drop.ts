/**
 *  The _mutator_ is called if _input_ is `Some<T>`.
 *
 *  This function allows you to cut the reference to the contain value from the inputted _input_.
 *  However, it would be unsafe operation if you do some more operation after this.
 *  For example, you can write the following code.
 *
 *  ```javascript
 *      const some = createSome(1);
 *      unsafeDropForOption(some, (some) => {
 *          some.ok = false;
 *      });
 *      isSome(some); // -> false. This is dangerous.
 *  ```
 *
 *  Compared to Rust, JavaScript does not have ownership semantics in language
 *  and this API is designed to use as a destructor or similar fashions.
 *  So if you call this for same object more than once, your code might contain "double free" problem.
 *
 *  @throws
 *  This throw an `Error` instance if the _input_ is frozen.
